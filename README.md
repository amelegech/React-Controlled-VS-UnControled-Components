# React-Controlled-VS-UnControled-Components
Controlled Vs un Controlled Components It's recommend using controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.  To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.
